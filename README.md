# Consumer Behavior and Retail Performance Analysis in the Chips Market 

## Overview
This project explores consumer behavior and retail performance within the chips market. The analysis investigates how affluence and trial store dynamics impact purchasing patterns and store performance. The goal is to equip category managers with data-driven insights to guide strategic planning and optimize marketing strategies.

## Project Structure
This project consists of three key sections:
1. **Data Preparation and Customer Analytics**
2. **Experimentation and Uplift Testing**
3. **Analytics and Commercial Application**

Each section focuses on cleaning data, analyzing customer behavior, and generating actionable insights through visualizations and structured reports.

## Key Insights

### 1. Data Integrity and Cleaning
- Ensuring transaction and customer data accuracy is crucial for meaningful analysis.
- Identifying and correcting inconsistencies (e.g., missing values and outliers) ensures reliable insights.

### 2. Sales Drivers and Customer Behavior
- Identifying key sales drivers helps in understanding purchasing behavior.
- Customer segmentation based on purchase patterns reveals profitable demographics.

### 3. Customer Segmentation
- **Mainstream Young Singles/Couples** are significant buyers of premium chips.
- **Families** prefer shareable packs, while **affluent customers** opt for premium and innovative flavors.
- **Impulse buying** is a notable trend among younger demographics, influencing product placement strategies.

### 4. Trial Store vs. Control Store Performance
- Trial stores exhibited **higher sales growth** than control stores.
- Marketing interventions like promotional displays and product sampling increased customer engagement.

### 5. Data Visualization for Effective Communication
- Using charts and graphs helps in presenting data insights clearly.
- Visual representation aids in understanding customer demographics and sales performance.

### 6. Strategic Recommendations
- Expand **premium product lines** for affluent customers while maintaining **value options**.
- Leverage **social media and influencer marketing** to target younger demographics.
- Optimize product placement in high-traffic areas to maximize impulse purchases.

### 7. Temporal Trends in Consumer Preferences
- Shifts in purchasing behavior reflect changing health trends and lifestyle adaptations.
- Businesses need to stay agile and adjust product offerings accordingly.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation
- Transaction and customer data were cleaned to remove inconsistencies.
- Customer segmentation was performed based on purchasing patterns.
- Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales volume and conversion rates were analyzed.

### 2. Experimentation and Uplift Testing
- A/B testing was conducted to compare trial stores with control stores.
- Results were assessed to determine the effectiveness of promotional strategies.

### 3. Analytics and Commercial Application
- Insights were translated into actionable commercial recommendations.
- A structured reporting framework was used for clear presentation.

## Results and Conclusion
- **Affluence Influences Buying Patterns**: Higher-income consumers favor premium brands, while lower-income groups prioritize affordability.
- **Life Stage Segmentation Matters**: Young adults opt for trendy, health-conscious options, whereas families prefer bulk purchases.
- **Trial Stores Outperform Control Stores**: Promotional activities successfully boosted sales and customer engagement.
- **Timely Reporting and Visualization Enhance Impact**: Clear, structured reports with visual aids improve stakeholder understanding.

## Recommendations for Future Strategy
1. **Expand Premium and Budget Offerings**: Balance between premium and cost-effective product lines to cater to all demographics.
2. **Leverage Digital Marketing**: Use social media and influencer collaborations to reach younger audiences.
3. **Optimize Retail Store Layout**: Position products strategically to enhance visibility and encourage impulse purchases.
4. **Continue Experimentation**: Conduct ongoing A/B testing to refine marketing strategies based on empirical data.

### **Technologies Used**

- **Python** for data processing and analysis
- **R** for data visualization
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive coding

## **How to Run the Code**

1. Clone the repository:
2. Navigate to the project folder:
3. Install dependencies:
>>> pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn #anaconda jupyter notebook already has these modules so no need of installing again
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to execute the analysis.

## Explanation of the Files in GitHub

At first glance, the files in this repository might seem confusing, and you might wonder, "What are all these files?" That's why I'm adding this section to guide you through them.

There are a total of seven files, including the README.md file, and each serves a specific purpose.

**Dataset Files**:
**QVI_transaction_data.xlsx** â€“ This is the primary dataset on which data preprocessing is performed. If you want to start analyzing the data in Jupyter Notebook, download this Excel file and import it using pandas to begin the data cleaning process.
**QVI_purchase_behaviour.xlsx** â€“ This dataset needs to be merged with the cleaned version of QVI_transaction_data.xlsx to gain further insights.
**QVI_data.xlsx** â€“ This is the final merged dataset, combining both QVI_transaction_data.xlsx and QVI_purchase_behaviour.xlsx.
That should clear up any confusion about the three datasets!

**Other Files:**
**Jupyter Analysis Notebook.ipynb** â€“ This notebook contains all the code related to data cleaning and analysis. You can refer to it while working with the dataset.
**Uplifting Testing.pdf** â€“ This document outlines the A/B testing conducted to compare trial stores with control stores. It also includes an assessment of the results to evaluate the effectiveness of promotional strategies. It also includes the visualizations.
**Detailed Code Explanation.ipynb** â€“ As the name suggests, this file provides a detailed breakdown of each piece of code, helping you understand its purpose and functionality.
And that's it! I hope this guide makes it easier for you to navigate through the files.

## **Credits & Acknowledgments**

This analysis was conducted as part of a virtual internship with **Quantium**. Special thanks to Quantium for providing the dataset and guiding the analytical approach.
